yes, something like that.
In x86(DOS) when u do a call to near function(near, that means program don't change a code segment(CS) register) processot does something like this:
	mov	sp,sp-2
	mov	[sp],ip (next executable ip)

when call'e ret executed processor does:
	mov	ip,[sp]
	mov	sp,sp+2

so, you inscruction after call should be
	call <some function>
	mov  [ipdrr], sp-2
you'll get the IP if this instuction;]
I think u got the idea, look for call inctruction execution inside cpu for more details. I whote here with intension that cpu's word is 2B;]
