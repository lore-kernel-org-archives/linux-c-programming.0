am i right in taking it as, you meant to say - execution of call instruction 
pushes the return address, which is the address of instruction following call 
instruction. in the example you mentioned it would be the address of instruction 
"pop ebp". since you are jumping to this instuction (via call), at the end of 
it's execution ebp will have the address of "pop ebp" instruction.
