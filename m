Try :

 Call ($+5)
  pop ebp

 you will get the current instruction which u r executing in ebp !!  This is how viruses works, they decrypt it in the memory and starts executing from the memory afterwardz..

  Here CALL instruction is 4 bytes instruction so call $+5 will call the 5th byte which is the next instruction. And based upon the "call" behavior, it pushes the next instruction on the stack first and then JUMP to the instruction. So, in this case, on the stack you will have the exact instruction which you are executing !

Enjoy,
Siddharth.
